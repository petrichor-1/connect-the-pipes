# The original code for [Connect the Pipes](https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/13pyjx5u37)
This is the original code for connect the pipes, using [Petrichorian Hopscript](https://github.com/petrichor-1/petrichorian-hopscript).

To create the hopscotch project, run `hopscotchify.js main.htn`. This works on commit 3ab8375 of petrichorian hopscript.
